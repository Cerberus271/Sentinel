# Sentinel
A fork of the original Sentinel project by Ray Hayes (http://sentinel.codeplex.com)

Sentinel is a log viewer (implemented in WPF) with configurable filtering, extracting, and highlighting (foreground/background colours). Custom classifiers allow messages to be parsed and recomposed prior to display.
